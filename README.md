# jdubinsky.dev personal domain

## What is it?

An over-engineered personal website to house links to github, linkedin, my resume, etc.

## Why is a personal domain running on lambda with node and typescript?

Great question - for fun! This is definitely way too much complexity as this could easily be achieved with a simple S3 bucket. However, I thought it would be a fun project to have it served using lambda with some cool concepts like:

- Infra as code (terraform)
- Continuous deployment
